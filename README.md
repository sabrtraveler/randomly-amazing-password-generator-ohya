# Password Generator Starter Code

This challenge of the bootcamp was to create a random password generator that an employee can use based on criteria selected.<br><br>
Thee password generator checks for the following criteria:<br><br>
<li>Makes sure the length of the password is between 8-128 characters.<br>
<li>Gives the user to choose either lowercase, uppercase, numerical and/or special characters. <br>
<li>The program alerts the user if they have not picked atleast one character type.<br>
<li>This project was great practice to learn javascript basics like creating variables, if statements and different types of loops. <br>
<li>Included comments in the .js file to be clear in what we are trying to accomplish in the code.<br><br>
The following images shows the web application's appearance and functionality:<br><br>
